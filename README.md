# Mikes Pizzeria

The goal of this project is to do my own take of the Pizzera task which was the first week's assingment for "Fall 2023 - JavaScript React upskill course"

## The problem

The main focus of this week's task was testing basic variables types and conditional statements. Because the project had a very linear structure with clearly defined steps the code was mainly written step by step. I used two techniques to improve the code while still trying to stay on topic for the task.

### Techniques used
#### 1. Wrapped the code as a function
Multiple steps in the task requried user input and then applied checks to verify the user input. By wrapping the code as a fuction we have the option to "return" from the program when a user inputs invalid data.

#### 2. Storing the food types and subtypes in an object.
Especially the subtype part required the handling of subtypes for 3 different food types. By storing the data in a object, the same code could be used to create all prompts for subtypes without repeating code. Further optimizations could have been done by using and looping through the food object or restructuring the structure further. But considering the purpose of the assignment I didnt want to optimize it too much.

### Further improvements
Obviously this is a very early and basic assignment but the main improvement I would have wanted to do is change the flow of the app to use actual visual steps for each user interaction. And by adding functionality to send the user back to a certain step together with a error message in case the user entered incorrect data.
